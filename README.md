# GitEvents

GitEvents is a GitHub Action that helps your organizers with templates,
interacts with your community members and automates typical event-related tasks
such as sending tweets and emails.

## Features

### Auto Invite

The basic idea behind "git events" is that every person who interacts with the
repository becomes a member of the organization/community. By becoming a member,
people get GitHub notifications from your organization, which makes it easier
for organizers to reach people and promotes interaction between your community.

### Comments

## Requirements

### GitEvents App

#### The short version

1. Create App
2. Install App for your organization/repo
3. Retrieve App ID
4. Retrieve Private Key
5. Retrieve Installation ID

#### In Detail

All comments, labels etc. will be managed by a GitHub App. You create the App
yourself on the Organization account:

[Create GitHub App](https://github.com/organizations/ORGANIZATION/settings/apps/new?name=gitevents&url=https://gitevents.org&description=A%20GitEvents%20App&request_oauth_on_install=false&public=false&issues=write&members=write&metadata=read&pull_requests=write&webhook_active=false)

_Replace ORGANIZATION with your organization name, such as CyprusJS, BarcelonaJS
etc._

Follow the link above and you don't need to make any changes except the name.
Pick a name, scroll down and create the App. After successful creation, you get
to the App Settings screen. Scroll down to the section "Private Key" and create
a key (it is downloaded immediately).

Head to the menu entry "Install App" and install the app in your organization.

Copy the App ID (`GE_APP_ID`), the installation ID (from the "Installed GitHub
Apps", `GE_APP_INSTALLATION_ID` ) and the private key (`GE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`)
into the repository settings -> "Secrets":
